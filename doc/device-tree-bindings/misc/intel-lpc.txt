Intel LPC Device Binding
========================

The device tree node which describes the operation of the Intel Low Pin
Count device is as follows:

Required properties :
- compatible = "intel,lpc"
- gen-dec : Specifies the values for the gen-dec registers. Up to four cell
   pairs can be provided - the first of each pair is the base address and
   the second is the size. These are written into the GENx_DEC registers of
   the LPC device


Example
-------

lpc {
	compatible = "intel,lpc";
	#address-cells = <1>;
	#size-cells = <1>;
	gen-dec = <0x800 0xfc 0x900 0xfc>;
};
