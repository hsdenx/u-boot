U-Boot for msc-nR-imx6
----------------------

Building U-boot
---------------

$ make msc_nR_imx6_config
$ make

Flashing U-boot into the SD card
--------------------------------

- After the 'make' command completes, the generated 'SPL' binary must be
flashed into the SD card;

$ sudo dd if=SPL of=/dev/mmcblk0 bs=1k seek=1; sync

(Note - the SD card node may vary, so adjust this as needed).

- Flash the u-boot.img image into the SD card:

sudo dd if=u-boot.img of=/dev/mmcblk0 bs=1k seek=69; sync

- Insert the SD card into the slot located in the bottom of the board (same side
as the mx6 processor)

- Connect the serial cable to the host PC

- Power up the board and U-boot messages will appear in the serial console.
