config DM
	bool "Enable Driver Model"
	depends on !SPL_BUILD
	help
	  This config option enables Driver Model. This brings in the core
	  support, including scanning of platform data on start-up. If
	  CONFIG_OF_CONTROL is enabled, the device tree will be scanned also
	  when available.

config SPL_DM
	bool "Enable Driver Model for SPL"
	depends on DM && SPL
	help
	  Enable driver model in SPL. You will need to provide a
	  suitable malloc() implementation. If you are not using the
	  full malloc() enabled by CONFIG_SYS_SPL_MALLOC_START,
	  consider using CONFIG_SYS_MALLOC_SIMPLE. In that case you
	  must provide CONFIG_SYS_MALLOC_F_LEN to set the size.
	  In most cases driver model will only allocate a few uclasses
	  and devices in SPL, so 1KB should be enable. See
	  CONFIG_SYS_MALLOC_F_LEN for more details on how to enable it.

config DM_WARN
	bool "Enable warnings in driver model"
	help
	  The dm_warn() function can use up quite a bit of space for its
	  strings. By default this is disabled for SPL builds to save space.
	  This will cause dm_warn() to be compiled out - it will do nothing
	  when called.

	default y if !SPL_BUILD
	default n if SPL_BUILD

config DM_DEVICE_REMOVE
	bool "Support device removal"
	help
	  We can save some code space by dropping support for removing a
	  device. This is not normally required in SPL, so by default this
	  option is disabled for SPL.
	depends on DM
	default y if !SPL_BUILD
	default n if SPL_BUILD

config DM_STDIO
	bool "Support stdio registration"
	help
	  Normally serial drivers register with stdio so that they can be used
	  as normal output devices. In SPL we don't normally use stdio, so
	  we can omit this feature.
